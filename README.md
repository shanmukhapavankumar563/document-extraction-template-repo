Please organize your repository as follows to ensure our team can review it efficiently:
* `/app`: Your source code and application files.
* `/samples`: We have provided initial samples. You are **highly encouraged** to generate and add your own samples (different formats) in sub-folders (e.g., `/training`, `/test`).
* `/output`: This is where the **sample outputs** (Excel files) of your data extraction process should lie.
* `/resumes`: Upload your resume here as a **PDF file**.
* `/design`: Place your detailed design documentation here (Images, PDF, or Docx).
* `README.md`: This file.

## 🛠️ Design & Documentation Requirements
We will **primarily review your design file** to evaluate your approach. Your documentation should be comprehensive and use whatever format (Images, Docx, PDF) best explains your logic.

**Your design file must include:**
* **Tech Stack:** Explain the libraries, tools, and languages used.
* **Component Design:** A detailed breakdown of your application's architecture.
* **Logic Flow:** Explain how the output is arrived at and, crucially, **how exceptions are handled**.
* **Visuals:** Use diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the system. You may also include sample outputs within this folder to support your explanation.
